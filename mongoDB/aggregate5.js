/**
 * The purpose of this lab is use the Aggregation Framework to create cursor-like stages.

In this lab, we want to select movies feature one or more of the following actors:

"Sandra Bullock",
"Tom Hanks",
"Julia Roberts",
"Kevin Spacey",
"George Clooney"
We also want to limit the movies to those with a USA release and a tomatoes.viewer.rating greater than or equal to 3. There should also be a new field num_favs that counts how of the actors listed above appear in the cast field of the movie.

These results should also be sorted by num_favs, tomatoes.viewer.rating, and title, all in descending order.

What is the title of the 25th film in the aggregation result?

For simplicity, we will use a variable ``favorites` to hold the list of actors.
